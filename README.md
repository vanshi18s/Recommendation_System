# Recommendation_System

# Recommender System Project

This project implements a memory-based collaborative filtering recommender system, specifically an **item-based collaborative filtering** approach, to suggest apps to users based on their usage patterns.

---

## Dataset

- Used an **app usage dataset** containing user interactions, app launches, timestamps, and other relevant features.
- Performed extensive **data cleaning and preprocessing** to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand data distributions, user behaviors, and app usage patterns.
- Derived valuable **insights** from the dataset to inform the modeling process.

---

## Approach

- Chose a **memory-based collaborative filtering** approach, focusing on **item-based filtering**.
- Built a **user-item interaction matrix** using features like **screentime**, **launches**, and **interactions**.
- Normalized the data to generate meaningful **ratings** for each user-app pair, ensuring fair comparisons.

---

## Model Development

- Developed the recommendation model by converting raw data into a **user-item matrix**.
- Implemented an **item similarity** calculation (e.g., cosine similarity) to find similar apps.
- Wrote custom Python functions to generate app recommendations for users.
- Tested the model's performance and evaluated its accuracy using **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**.

---

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python** for data processing and modeling.
- **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization.
- **scikit-learn** for metrics like `mean_squared_error`.
- Custom user-defined functions for recommendation logic.

---

## Evaluation

- Assessed model performance by calculating the **RMSE** between predicted and actual ratings.
- Used the evaluation to fine-tune the model and improve recommendation quality.

---

## Summary

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a recommender system, from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model implementation and evaluation, using a memory-based collaborative filtering approach.

---

## Future Work

- Explore more advanced recommender systems.
- Incorporate additional features like bluetooth and WiFi Functionalities.
- Experiment with hybrid approaches for better accuracy.
